In Node.js development, tracing a coding error back to its source can save a lot of time over the course of a project. But as a program grows in complexity, it becomes harder and harder to do this efficiently. To solve this problem, developers use tools like a debugger, a program that allows developers to inspect their program as it runs. By replaying the code line-by-line and observing how it changes the programâ€™s state, debuggers can provide insight into how a program is running, making it easier to find bugs.
