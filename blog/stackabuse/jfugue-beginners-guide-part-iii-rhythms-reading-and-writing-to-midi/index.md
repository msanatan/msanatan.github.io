In this tutorial, we will learn how to create rhythms using the Rhythm class, how to use JFugue's built-in RhythmKit to conveniently create rhythm, and how to apply different rhythm instruments to our song. We will also cover how to save our music to a MIDI file using the JFugue, and how to read music from a MIDI file using the JFugue library.
