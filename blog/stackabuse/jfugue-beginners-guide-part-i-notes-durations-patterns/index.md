JFugue is an open-source Music library that allows you to play and compose MIDI music using the Java programming language. It uses their "Staccato" format to parse strings of musical instructions. By using JFugue, you can convert the Staccato strings into a MIDI file, as well as import a MIDI file, and convert the content into human-readable strings.
