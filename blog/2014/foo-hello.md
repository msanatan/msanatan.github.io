Hi everyone,

This is my official, first blog post to announce myself to the world! While I brainstorm how best I can release my propaganda, I should at least let you know that you'll be seeing code, computer theory, policy, basically anything tech. You'll also get a bit about life and being Caribbean :)

By the way, this website has an IPv6 address (and if you got a website you should ensure it does too!)
