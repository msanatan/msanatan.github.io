S/O to Hassan Voyeau for this geeky interview that's featuring on his blog. Hassan created and maintains <a href="http://techtt.hassantt.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">T3CHTT</a>, an all encompassing technology blog with an international coverage and a Trinbagonian focus. He's kickstarting a weekly segment that interviews someone from the technology space - and I'm first up :). Normally the first attempt tends to lack refinement, like the first pancake I made this morning... But I got a feeling that this was pretty awesome and you'll enjoy it!
