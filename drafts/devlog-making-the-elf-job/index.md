## Preparing for the Jam

- No more Unity, going back to Godot
- Doing the Godot tutorial again
- Making a practice Godot game, starting with a UI and platformer
- Fixing my setup with VS Code, a seemingly minor fix that made a huge improvement in my develoepr experience

## Design

- Wanting to make an adventure game
- What would this map look like? Hidden bells
- Dialogue, who would the player speak with
- Assets! I need to focus on coding, so I need good art from elsewhere

## Project Management

- Using GitHub Projects to define tasks and outline them

## Game Development

- Godot makes a lot of things easy, like 2D movement and animations for sprites.
- Tilesets were very hard to setup. It took the practice before the jam, and some tutorials during the jam for me to really figure out what's happening
- There was also a Tilemap system bug that only affected Macs... Luckily they released version 3.4.1 which fixed it
- Random rant: antivirus takes up so many resources!
- After Tilemap bug and setup, it was easy
- Didn't write my won dialogue system, 2 videos with Dialogic plugin were perfect for the task and gave it a lot of polish
- I still never finish in time to devote to music properly, but I got good free options.

## Prepping for Release

- WebGL build
- Flow: create page, submit game, improve page with gifs and instructions, and a more personal theme
- Flow for creating gifs: screen record, convert to gif, resize to appropriate dimensions and file size

## Feedback

- Very positive, the Pokemon/JRPG feel was a common kudos
- Art and music was really well received
- People needed a bit more direction to get back to Santa, or find places generally
- Lots of players ignored instructions and wandered on their own lol. That's great, I'm making the games I love playing

## Next Steps

- The environment will have more NPCs and objects - didn't have time to add them earlier
- Add signs and better environmental cues for an area, definitely want to make it easier for people to find their way back to Santa
- Let Santa, someone or some other mechanism reiterate the location of bells
- Mobile controls!
- Extra polish items, like scene transitions.
