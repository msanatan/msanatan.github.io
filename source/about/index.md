My name Marcus Sanatan, a game and web developer based in Trinidad and Tobago. The things that grab my interest and will most likely blog about (in no particular order) are:

* Game Development (mostly with Phaser)
* Front-end Development with React
* Mobile Development with React Native
* Caribbean Development
* Open Data
* Open Source Software
* Puppies - I actually don't blog about them but who doesn't love them?

I help out with ClickToStart, a non-profit digital literacy organisation in Trinidad and Tobago, teaching an introductory programming class using Python and some basics with Pygame.
