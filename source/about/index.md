Hi! I'm Marcus Sanatan, a software developer from Trinidad and Tobago. The things that grab my interest and will most likely blog about are (in no particular order):

* Back-end Development with Go and Python (Flask, Django)
* Game Development (Godot and Phaser)
* Front-end Development with React.js. I like TypeScript as well
* Mobile Development with React Native
* Caribbean Development
* Puppies! I actually don't blog about them but who doesn't love them?

I also write for another blog, [Stack Abuse](https://stackabuse.com/author/marcus/). Those articles are pretty much programming tutorials. And I've been editing some other article for the platform as well. Check them out!
