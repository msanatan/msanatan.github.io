Hi! I'm Marcus Sanatan, a web and game developer from Trinidad and Tobago. The things that grab my interest and will most likely blog about are (in no particular order):

* Game Development (Phaser, Kontra and Godot)
* Front-end Development with Vue.js
* Mobile Development with Flutter
* Back-end Development with Go and Python
* Caribbean Development
* Puppies! I actually don't blog about them but who doesn't love them?

I also write for another blog, [Stack Abuse](https://stackabuse.com/author/marcus/). Those articles are pretty much programming tutorials, with Python as my language of choice.

Unless otherwise mentioned, all views expressed on this website are my own and do not represent the views of my employer or any organisation I am affiliated with.
