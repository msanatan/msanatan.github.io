*This rant is primarily for Trinidad and Tobago, but I'm sure it applies
to other locations.*

(Lovely) Person: So what do you do?
Me: I'm a software developer/programmer/coder/blah
Person: So you make mobile apps, right?

The last question is usually followed by "Can you make an app for me?"
or "I'm working on an
android/ios/windows/ionic/&lt;platform-framework-combination&gt;..."
without me being able to reply. This scenario has been repeated so many
times that I've learnt to just stay quiet until I can give an honest
reply:

"Not really, I don't know much about app development. I can survive some
web dev and I'm decent with other things".

Person: Oh... Ok...

# We're not all the same. We just happen to eat lots of pizza for some reason
One issue I have with this mobile app development bombardment is that
it's a pretty myopic view of a software developer's capabilities
and passion. Believe it or not, the idea of creating the next app
with millions of users doesn't excite me. Why? No particular reason, it
just doesn't excite me. Hey, all credit to those who do just that or are
trying to. Like most techies I'm no stranger to apps and I think
regionally we got some ones to look out for (check out
[TapTag](http://www.taptagit.com/) and
[BitBox](http://prelaunch.bitboxtt.com/)). And it's not like making
killer apps do not have their fair share of [interesting challenges and
solutions](http://www.wired.com/2015/09/whatsapp-serves-900-million-users-50-engineers/). Any
interesting project would get a developer excited. Even so, there is an
unabated obsession with apps that just makes me feel like the entire
country is living on the **hype train**. What really bothers me is not
just that I'm always asked if I make mobile apps (some just assume I do
and just ask me which platform has my affinity), it's the quality of the
app they want to make. Like seriously, this situation is too common for
my liking:

"Hey, hear me out. I got this cool idea for an app that does something
another pretty well known app most likely created in the USA already
does, but the company isn't registered here yet so I think I have a
chance of being a better hustler for their market". Many don't even
mention why they think their solution would be better. I just can't
anymore

# I am not ranting... not purposefully, I think
I understand why, a smart phone is in almost everyone's hands and apps
are therefore pervasive. Plus the world is enamoured with startup
companies making more apps. I get it... but if we're so passionate about
technology why can't we address some other issues we have with it in
T&T? If you want better apps let's try to work these things out - net
neutrality, viable ecommerce for small businesses and (quality) open
data. I wouldn't mind the app hype if the entire ecosystem was there.
Doesn't help that the most app makers don't even try to address the
gaps. For some reason a million regional software developers care about
music and have to make an app for it (we Caribbeans do love our music
though). Again, it's all good. Just not me.

## Yes, I am ranting
As a culture we tend to consume and not value indigenous creations.
People in T&T seek validation from abroad. It's why the next Usain Bolt
will probably never come from our twin islands. It was admittedly part
of the motivation for me to study abroad (not the main reason but I'm
still guilty). And it's probably why most developers just create
something that's already out there, "give the masses what they know they
want". It makes the average route for a developer here pretty
boring: either get involved with some enterprise software
presumably built on .NET or make some consumer app that is "heavily
inspired" from another app but more than likely isn't a significant
improvement from the original. Now someone doesn't have to go that
route, but the average developer will and we could make things better
for her/him. If you're a citizen demand more from your government and
businesses to access their information and services through IT. If
you're an organisation, make IT more than just some operational chore
but as a key component to your productivity and output. I know those
suggestions are "fluffy" (look at this [article about being a leader in
IT](http://www.techrepublic.com/article/make-tech-innovation-a-top-it-priority-or-risk-getting-left-behind/),
the word "innovation" appears more than "technology" or "the" or
"Schmetterling") but I feel strongly that our main hindrance to "app
heaven" is in our attitudes, not creative abilities.

# Before we close
"I bet this guy hasn't made apps before" - Been through some Android
tutorials and used PhoneGap about 3/4 times. So not never but not a lot,
I wouldn't call myself an app developer for the projects I've done.

"What if you have to make an app for your job? You'll be screwed" -
Probably not. Like good professionals, I learn new skills all the time.
If I have to make an app for some person/solution, I'll thoroughly learn
how to create a usable app.

"The author is a hipster, or maybe C programmer - they're always angry" - My
hipster/mainstream taste is pretty balanced - my YouTube history is full of
Drake, Nujabes and Lamp (Japanese indie jazz band, damn amazing). I know some
C but I'm not a C programmer, I seldom have a use for it.

"Since you don't make apps, what do you actually do?" - I have gotten
lots of PJs for web scraping and I've made a couple of APIs with Node.js +
MySQL/Mongo. Other little scripts come up here and there. I'm learning
how to make games with [Phaser](http://phaser.io/)! I'll be sure to blog
about it if any of my games make it to &lt;your-platform-of-choice&gt;
app store &#x1f609;.

Happy apping everyone!
