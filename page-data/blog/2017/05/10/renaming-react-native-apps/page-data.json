I’m not interested in starting flame wars, before this I thoroughly enjoyed using Angular and Ionic. React does seem to be easier to get up and running, and it seems to suit my thinking a lot better as well.</p>\n<p>While noobing through the various tutorials and blogs for React Native, I decided to increase the scope of my practice app and I felt that a renaming was in order. Changing the class name is fine, and the only other changes that came to mind were the name attribute in <strong>app.json</strong> and the first argument in the <strong>registerComponent</strong> function in the app itself.</p>\n<p>If you then try to run <code class=\"language-text\">react-native run-ios</code> or android you’ll get an alarming red error message on the simulator. Yikes! You’ll quickly observe that the app being loaded has the old name and a quick <code class=\"language-text\">ls</code> in the android and ios folders will make it even more obvious. The fix is easy:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Delete the android and ios folders</li>\n<li>Run <code class=\"language-text\">react-native eject</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The eject command recreates the native folders for you, using what’s in <strong>app.json</strong> to define the project.</p>\n<p>Next time you run you should have your app with its new name on the simulator without problems, assuming your other bits of code are fine.</p>\n<p>Happy hacking!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Renaming React Native Apps","tags":["javascript","react","react native"],"date":"2017-05-10","updated":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2016/09/27/switch-to-static"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Switching to a Static Website"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2017/06/18/react-native-lessons-from-first-app"},"frontmatter":{"title":"React Native: Lessons from First App"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"73c351af-66d1-52d7-ae67-0722ae73ed35","previousPostId":"f1c8ff9c-d4af-5494-9b53-c222f3a2d2fb","nextPostId":"6d642388-b856-5732-8c9a-c0c21d245d50"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1391858338"],"slicesMap":{}}
