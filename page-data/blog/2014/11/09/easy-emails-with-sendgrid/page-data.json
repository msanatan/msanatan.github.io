It didn’t have to do much so some quick Node.js scripting was good enough for the task. One of the things that needed to be done was to send an email after some data was processed.</p>\n<h2>SendGrid To The Rescue</h2>\n<p>So maybe I found out the server needed to send emails a few hours before a demonstration… I needed something that was quick to setup and easy to use. With some light googling I came across <a href=\"https://sendgrid.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">SendGrid</a>, a company all about sending email. They got an amazing API and the docs are easy to follow. Aside from Node.js they support many other languages and frameworks, even Perl has support!</p>\n<p>It’s dead easy to get up and running, look at this small code snippet to send something off</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"coffeescript\"><pre class=\"language-coffeescript\"><code class=\"language-coffeescript\"><span class=\"token comment\"># Give it your API username and password when importing</span>\nsendgrid <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">require</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'sendgrid'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> config<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>sendgridApiUser<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> config<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>sendgridApiPassword\n\nmessage <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">'Some non-spammy text hopefully'</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># The Email object has lots of parameters to customise your email</span>\nemail <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">sendgrid<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>Email</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">to</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'some@body.com'</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">from</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'you@sexything.com'</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">bcc</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">'keep the illuminati in the know'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">subject</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'SendGrid wins'</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">text</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> message\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># And a simple send function to do the job</span>\nsendgrid<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>send email<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>err<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> json<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">-</span><span class=\"token operator\">></span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> err<span class=\"token operator\">?</span>\n        console<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>log err\n    console<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>log json</code></pre></div>\n<p>And for basic purposes that’ll do. You can send HTML as well, just setup your message with the right tags and switch ‘text’ in the Email object to ‘html’. All this and so much more is covered in the <a href=\"https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">docs</a>.</p>\n<h2>SendGrid Is Not Alone</h2>\n<p>This is just the solution that I used, don’t limit yourself to just SendGrid. There are an abundance of email delivery service providers out there - MailChimp, mailgun, Mailjet, the list is really long! Their free plans give you an abundance of emails to use for a small project, I thought SendGrid’s 200/day was more than enough, and the popular ones got Node.js wrappers for their APIs.</p>\n<p>You should also look at <a href=\"http://www.nodemailer.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Nodemailer</a>, a library that pretty much is what it sounds like. This is truly the most popular email solution for Node.js, and they work well with SendGrid too. This library would make your email delivery service provider agnostic, which is cool :) and it can be extended with their API for plugins. Truth be told, it’s as simple to use as SenGrid’s library plus one step to connect to an SMTP server.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Easy Emails with SendGrid","tags":["coffeescript","javascript","node.js"],"date":"2014-11-09","updated":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2014/10/31/small-website-go-flask-and-use-blueprints"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Small Website?
