Static websites were left behind for some time. Luckily mail has become a service, so it can be sent via an API.</p>\n<h2>Basic Page Setup</h2>\n<p>At the very least, you need a page with a form in it, pretty straigthforward. If you’re using Hexo like I am then you’ll add a template for your contact page’s form (usually a <code class=\"language-text\">.ejs</code> file) and create a Markdown file in your <code class=\"language-text\">source</code> directory to use that template.</p>\n<h2>Formspree</h2>\n<p>So there’s a “Contact page as a Service” called <a href=\"https://formspree.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Formspree</a>. It saves you from having to build and deploy an app that processes post data, and sends you an email via SendGrid/MailChimp/mail server. It has a free tier that’ll suit the needs of most personal blogs and it’s also <a href=\"https://github.com/formspree/formspree\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">open source</a>.</p>\n<p>There’s isn’t much to it aside from adding their URL with your email to the form’s action, and naming a couple of <code class=\"language-text\">input</code> fields. No registration required, you’re just assumed to be in the free tier until you sign up for the paid one. It’s built with Flask and is pretty easy to get a hold on if required.</p>\n<p>They’re not the only one though, <a href=\"https://formcarry.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">formcarry</a> and <a href=\"https://formspark.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Formspark</a> offer similar services with prices that might be better suited for certain business cases. In any case, don’t let your theme be the only thing that lets a static site fly, APIs give you wings!</p>\n<p>Happy forming!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Add a Contact Form to Your Static Site","tags":["javascript","hexo"],"date":"2019-09-09","updated":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2019/07/18/mock-servers-with-openapi-and-api-sprout"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mock Servers with OpenAPI and API Sprout"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2019/10/06/october-2019-game-project-approximately"},"frontmatter":{"title":"October 2019 Game Project: Approximately"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"e173ea51-0fcb-5139-94c2-444d7fe0e72b","previousPostId":"4fe133e7-7a4a-5fa4-9b2d-f10b8c2ec9ee","nextPostId":"f9bfdf21-d461-5f42-b195-b9fd1833d722"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1391858338"],"slicesMap":{}}
