It started at the end of <a href=\"https://itch.io/jam/jammin-2019\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Jammin 2019</a> and I was finally able to close it off in October. The theme for that jam was Growth, so the game plays on that concept with a super simple puzzler.</p>\n<p>You’ll be presented with a group of balls on the top half of the screen, and you’ll need to guess their colletive size on the bottom half of the screen. You can increase/grow the size of the current ball you got, and add up to 2 more balls as well. Check it out!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gameboymarcus.itch.io/approximately\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><a href=\"https://gameboymarcus.itch.io/approximately\">https://gameboymarcus.itch.io/approximately</a></a></p>\n<h2>Tech Things</h2>\n<p>This project was done with <a href=\"https://phaser.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Phaser 3</a> and <a href=\"http://www.typescriptlang.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">TypeScript</a>. Phaser was not needed for this game as it doesn’t need a game loop. However, it was a good opportunity to try Phaser 3’s scaling options and see how they work on mobile devices.</p>\n<p>As the user interacts with a mouse on desktop, touch automatically works on mobile. The <code class=\"language-text\">FIT</code> mode was the best option for this game, and with little effort everything was mobile friendly!</p>\n<p>I used <a href=\"https://parceljs.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Parcel</a> to bundle the code as it’s dead simple. That simplicity sacrifices speed as building the app could take anywhere from 2 - 10 seconds. For a larger web game, I rather invest some time getting webpack optimised.</p>\n<p>Uploading the game to <a href=\"https://itch.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><a href=\"https://itch.io\">https://itch.io</a></a> was pretty straightforward, at least for a free one. As itch provides a stream of just released games (and there are many new indie games released all the time, what a beautiful platform), I got a few more players than I expected. That was pretty cool.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you’re deploying a web game on itch then you’ll have to add <code class=\"language-text\">--public-url '.'</code> when building the app. Itch can host your web games but they need to use relative URLs. By default, parcel builds with absolute URLs.</p>\n<h2>Reflections</h2>\n<p>I really enjoyed working on this! Phaser has always been one of those intuitive frameworks that I got attached too.</p>\n<p>The scaling options open so many doors for mobile friendly games, I’m honestly pretty excited by what can be done. Credit to the Phaser devs for making it so easy.</p>\n<p>I’m also all for TypeScript in my Phaser games. It isn’t necessary to get something going, even a large game can be done comfortably with standard EcmaScript. However, those errors I got about functions not being available for a certain type and being able see the types of function arguments were so helpful. All little time savings add up!</p>\n<p>There’s a lot of work that can be done to improve this game: more levels, menu, music and saving progress to name a few. The play time is about 5 minutes, somewhat reflective of the time I used to develop it.
