It was run by people who created my <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/godot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Godot course on Udemy</a>. While I made lots of progress in that course, I felt that there was still a lot more content to cover before I could make a game that I like. Starting the game jam over a week late, I figure I’d stick with Phaser which I’m pretty comfortable with!</p>\n<p>Cuadrado’s Trials is a short platformer you can play in your browser with your keyboard. You can play it here: <a href=\"https://gameboymarcus.itch.io/cuadrados-trials\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><a href=\"https://gameboymarcus.itch.io/cuadrados-trials\">https://gameboymarcus.itch.io/cuadrados-trials</a></a>. Time permitting I would have added a lot more dynamic components to it. But it was cool to see something from start to finish, and it seemed to be enjoyable to quite a few people. Some found it hard, I found it too easy haha.</p>\n<p>I wrote my devlog on itch.io, here are the links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://gameboymarcus.itch.io/cuadrados-trials/devlog/148304/thinking-up-cuadrados-trials\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Thinking up Cuadrado’s Trials</a> - here you’ll see my early iteration and the fairly drastic improvements made at the start of this journey.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gameboymarcus.itch.io/cuadrados-trials/devlog/149502/platforms-for-a-platformer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Platforms for a platformer</a> - a lot of time was spent wrapping my head around movement. Moving tiles and jumping had to feel right.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gameboymarcus.itch.io/cuadrados-trials/devlog/150974/jam-submission\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Jam Submission!</a> - my postmortem! The community was really supportive and gave lots of feedback. I was pretty happy with it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So far this is the largest game I’ve made, at least outside a tutorial. I started using <a href=\"https://www.aseprite.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Aseprite</a> and it’s by far the best pixel art editor I’ve used. All in all, I had loads of fun and there’s been a lot more Phaser projects + game dev since. They will be blogged about on another day :-D</p>\n<p>Happy game developing!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Cuadrado's Trials, an Overdue Recap","tags":["phaser","javascript","game development"],"date":"2020-10-20","updated":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2020/04/19/encoding-and-returning-large-json-in-golang"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Encoding and Returning Large JSON in Golang"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2020/11/08/loading-fonts-in-phaser-with-fontface"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Loading Fonts in Phaser with FontFace"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"d3b02ad2-96f2-5a67-b06a-bc21def76079","previousPostId":"006738a2-a2b1-5b26-8895-1e3ce14f3d18","nextPostId":"ecbdcd2f-3f4c-56c4-8b18-e469ae58ea27"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1391858338"],"slicesMap":{}}
