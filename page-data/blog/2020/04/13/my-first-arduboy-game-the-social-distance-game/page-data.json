Right before my country’s lockdown began, I collected my long-awaited Arduboy.</p>\n<p>I guess this game’s idea was natural. You play as an adorable sprite called Ghostie (why not?) and try your best to avoid contact with the various pedestrians. Here’s a screenshot of my first Arduboy game - The Social Distance Game:</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 545px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/b2ec6e84467f2353986f12ae70e4b860/3ddad/screenshot01.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 57.333333333333336%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Screenshot of Social Distance Game\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/b2ec6e84467f2353986f12ae70e4b860/3ddad/screenshot01.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/b2ec6e84467f2353986f12ae70e4b860/8a4e8/screenshot01.png 150w,\n/static/b2ec6e84467f2353986f12ae70e4b860/5a46d/screenshot01.png 300w,\n/static/b2ec6e84467f2353986f12ae70e4b860/3ddad/screenshot01.png 545w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Like life, it’s unfair so don’t stress about racking up high points.

While simple to conceive and execute, I’ve learnt a lot. If you’re new or considering getting the Arduboy, I hope my reflections will help out!</p>\n<h2>Setting up on Mac</h2>\n<p>When I first got the Arduboy, it came loaded with a really fun game called <a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://community.arduboy.com/t/sirene-tenth-team-a-r-g-game/2206\">Sirène</a>. I wanted to play a few other games as the catalogue really impressed me.</p>\n<p>On the main website it has a <a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://arduboy.com/upload-games/\">list of software</a> to upload Arduboy binaries (a .hex file or the community created .arduboy file).</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, at this point in time I can only use the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software#download\">Arduino IDE</a>. The IDE is easy to use and works well but I imagine it’s a lot less convenient than the dedicated loaders.</p>\n<p>Well, I’m experimenting with a Python and Node.js script to see which works better for me. If either works out, I’ll make a small GUI for it.</p>\n<p>In any case, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://community.arduboy.com/t/arduboy-uploader-for-mac/8728\">I asked the community about it</a>. Seems that with a bit of patience I’ll have my game loader on Mac!</p>\n<h2>The Community and Github</h2>\n<p>While talking about setting up on the Mac, I’ve mentioned the community a lot. The community is one of the strengths of the Arduboy. The members are active, helpful, respectful and sometimes inspiring.</p>\n<p>When developing this game, the community forum was one of my most important resources. A lot of questions you have are probably already there. When you ask a question, it’s safe to expect a genuinely helpful response.</p>\n<p>Another major resource for me to figure out how to make games were Github repositories. Arduboy and Open Source were married from the start. As someone who hasn’t touched C++ in a while, the plethora of example code helped me determine the best way forward more than once.</p>\n<p>On that note…</p>\n<h2>Re-learning C++</h2>\n<p>I last consistently coded in C++ 10 years ago. My oh my, how things have changed. Arduino also doesn’t have the standard C++ libraries which probably reduced the familiarity a bit more as well.</p>\n<p>I spent a good bit of time making this game on re-learning C++ and trying to catch up with modern best practices. I actually want to spend some time learning it from scratch once more. The best developers don’t keep swimming in shallow water, at some point I have to do a deep dive into the language and the Arduino ecosystem to be really competent.</p>\n<h2>A Better Development Experience</h2>\n<p>The Arduino IDE was my gateway to playing games as well as developing them. The tutorials used them, and their integration made it pretty sensible to use.</p>\n<p>If you don’t mind having one big file with all your code.</p>\n<p>At most, my file was about 400 lines long which is pretty manageable. And yet, it still felt wrong. Admittedly I didn’t spend a lot of time getting to know the IDE’s short cuts and customizations. Truth is, I don’t want to.</p>\n<p>I’m pretty happy with <a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://vscodium.com\">VS Codium</a>(VS Code without the Microsoft tracking and other non-OSS bits). Thankfully, there’s an excellent but preview VS Codium extension aptly called “Arduino”. It can compile and upload your game (using the IDE it seems).</p>\n<p>The extension was created by Microsoft, they’re doing a good job! What about the reason for switching to VS Codium? Well, the extension is under the MIT license. The privacy policy…</p>\n<h2>Art and Sound</h2>\n<p>Pixel art is fun, and the sprites for this game were pretty simple. However, the standard for art and music is <a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSXqe7TXcM8\">pretty darn high</a>.</p>\n<p>This game I used a lot of different things. The sprites were created in <a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.piskelapp.com\">Piskel</a>. It’s free, online and easy to use. Animations are quite cool too.</p>\n<p>However, it’s a bit hard to manage when you got a lot of sprites. Piskel would do a lot better by being able to create folders. I guess that’s where we come in and help out in OSS right?</p>\n<p>I also looked away from Piskel because writing text was hard. Fonts that work for a screen that’s 128px wide and 64px long are few and far between. Drawing letters are a bit tricky for me right now.</p>\n<p>At this time I went back to <a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gimp.org\">Gimp</a>, which I experimented with for pixel art a bit over a year ago. I used the monospace fonts to write the text for my basic title screen. Given the scope of this mini-game, it was fine.</p>\n<p>Art is one part of a good game. Music is right up there as well! I have the least amount of experience in this domain. Thankfully some good folks created a track editor for Arduboy games: <a href=\"http://teamarg.github.io/trackerEditor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><a href=\"http://teamarg.github.io/trackerEditor\">http://teamarg.github.io/trackerEditor</a></a>. I only wanted one sound effect and got it pretty easily. It didn’t’ work in Chrome but all was well in Firefox.</p>\n<h2>Another One</h2>\n<p>Working on this game got me more excited about the Arduboy and the community I’ve now become a part of. My partner and I wrote down a few ideas of what to build, but I think I’ll work on a platformer next.</p>\n<p>Happy gaming everyone!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"My First Arduboy Game - The Social Distance Game","tags":["c++","arduboy","game development"],"date":"2020-04-13","updated":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2020/02/19/golang-shared-objects-in-docker-alpine-containers"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Golang Shared Objects in Docker Alpine Containers"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2020/04/19/accessing-nodejs-modules-with-create-react-app-and-electron"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Accessing Node.js Modules with Create React App and Electron"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"1b347eff-fac9-54a3-acfe-345c38f98a08","previousPostId":"abb01b12-3447-52ec-8035-499bd88aefb1","nextPostId":"f68b0bed-ac21-502d-8995-4c31536c1969"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1391858338"],"slicesMap":{}}
