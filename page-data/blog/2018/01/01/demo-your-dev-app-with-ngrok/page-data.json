This tool connects to your app running on localhost and securely exposes it to the world. It’s really useful when you’re developing a webhook to get a secure https link that can be tested immediately.</p>\n<p>It’s just one file to download and unzip. To make life easier, make a symlink to <code class=\"language-text\">/usr/local/bin</code> so you can run it from anywhere in the terminal:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token builtin class-name\">cd</span> /usr/local/bin\n<span class=\"token function\">ln</span> <span class=\"token parameter variable\">-s</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>Path to unzipped ngrok download<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>/ngrok ngrok</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now you can just run <code class=\"language-text\">ngrok http [port]</code>. It exposes http and https connections, the latter being particularly useful for things like Facebook Messenger API that require secure connections. One of the best features is the inspector, as ngrok is running head on to <a href=\"http://localhost:4040\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><a href=\"http://localhost:4040\">http://localhost:4040</a></a> and you’ll be able to have a look at any request made to your application. There’s much more to it in the docs and paid plans that offer unique features and reduces many restrictions.</p>\n<p>Happy New Year and happy hacking!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Demo Your Dev App with Ngrok","tags":["bash"],"date":"2018-01-01","updated":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2017/11/06/phaser-es2015-and-breakout"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Phaser, ES2015 and Breakout"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2018/03/01/update-join-statements-to-the-mysql-rescue"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Update-Join Statements to the MySQL Rescue"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"7ead8f74-f755-5ea9-84a8-8178f2bb40b0","previousPostId":"d5267332-6414-5ebd-8d4d-c4531b1ab0f1","nextPostId":"d472cf50-4a7b-5875-959b-57a6b7dc4bef"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1391858338"],"slicesMap":{}}
