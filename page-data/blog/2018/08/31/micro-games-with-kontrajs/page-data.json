Essentially you got to make a game in JavaScript that when zipped is 13kb or less. Sounds like fun!</p>\n<p>The constraints forces some interesting creativity, from my observations the winners had the following traits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Streamlined build process to ensure they don’t go over the limit</li>\n<li>Little to no external assets - all were converted to JS beforehand</li>\n<li>Procedurally generated maps</li>\n<li>Awesome canvas code or a microframework</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I’ve done games from the canvas API before but it can be tedious if it becomes sufficiently complex. So looking for some viable options I discovered <a href=\"https://straker.github.io/kontra\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Kontra.js</a>. This microframework was pretty much built to help compete in this competition, it boasts a winner using it as well.</p>\n<p>While the game engine is easy to use you should still expect to use some canvas code when you’ll want to customise. It doesn’t take long to get started, I made a little playground for myself to get a hang of core mechanics <a href=\"https://msanatan.com/kontra-playground\">https://msanatan.com/kontra-playground</a>. There’s also an excellent tutorial from the developer who created Kontra: <a href=\"https://medium.com/web-maker/making-asteroids-with-kontra-js-and-web-maker-95559d39b45f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/web-maker/making-asteroids-with-kontra-js-and-web-maker-95559d39b45f\">https://medium.com/web-maker/making-asteroids-with-kontra-js-and-web-maker-95559d39b45f</a></a>.</p>\n<p>Hopefully this little snippet was enough to get you guys interested and push forward your HTML5 game development journey</p>\n<p>Happy micro-game developing!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Micro Games with Kontra.js","tags":["javascript","kontra","js13k","game development"],"date":"2018-08-31","updated":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2018/08/31/dynamodb-lambdas-go-and-an-empty-list"},"frontmatter":{"title":"DynamoDB, Lamdbas, Go and an Empty List"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2019/01/14/static-sites-for-quick-relief"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Static Sites for Quick Relief"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"0351e6c7-fc3e-5eb6-85e4-dbb94f71df2e","previousPostId":"8488a051-81f1-5a78-a565-5e07a86fc78c","nextPostId":"24ea833c-81f0-5030-95ad-d1f5a33fdc75"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1391858338"],"slicesMap":{}}
